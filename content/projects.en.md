## Fairytale Forest

My first web application in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). It was made with my heart for event wich is organized by association called [Rudická mládež](https://rudickamladez.cz). There was a problem with people overflow when the when the event starts. Because the capacity is limited by [Wind Mill in Rudice](http://www.rudice.cz/index.php?page=informacni-stredisko) Now my web application is solving everything.

## St. Nicholas afternoon

Another web application wich I created in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and made for [Rudická mládež](https://rudickamladez.cz). I fixed the workload of the reservations, because previously it was possible to order children for this small village event *only* by phone or email. Now my web application is solving everything.

## Teamwork management

I did my *maturita* project, which is a web application again in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The aim of this project is to simplify the entire administration, which is currently done manually using tools from the MS Office suite and emails from students, and thus make it easier for all cantors and students at [Purkyňka](https://www.sspbrno.cz/).

## TLAIO

The aim of this project was to control traffic lights in the city using artificial intelligence. Our open source project was born in October 2018 before the AT&T Hackathon Junior competition, where we created the whole project in Python in less than 24 hours, and in the competition we won the award for *The Best Technical Solution*. We also continued the project in our free time and entered a competition called [JA Studentská firma roku](https://jaczech.org/programy-ja-czech/st%C5%99edn%C3%AD-a-vy%C5%A1%C5%A1%C3%AD-odborn%C3%A9-%C5%A1koly/ja-studentsk%C3%A1-firma/) where we were successful in several categories.

## Burning witches

My first web application ever, which I started making at the beginning of my second year of study at [Purkyňka](https://www.sspbrno.cz/). It helped me process songs on request from people in the audience at the Burning of Witches in Rudice, where I was in charge of providing the sound for this event.

## Pneumobil Racing Team Brno

There is a student team at [FSI BUT](https://www.fme.vutbr.cz/en/) that develops air-powered vehicles.
I designed a static website for them exactly according to their requirements.
The source codes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/lukynmatuska/pneumobilteam.cz).
The web presentation itself can be found on the [pneumobilteam.cz](https://pneumobilteam.cz/) domain.
